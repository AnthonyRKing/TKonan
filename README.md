Off to an awesome start!

Wow, no hints about formatting when editing this README.md file. I'm sure I've seen formatting. Perhaps I need to make a README.html.

But no! GitHub doesn't allow any HTML readme, it seems. The way is md - markdown, and there's a whole syntax for it described at [GitHub Writing and Formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).
